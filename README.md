# Dom App Project

This project was thought for me with the intention of helping and making easier book's clubs voting the next volume for the next season ðŸ“š

Once I'm a participant of a book club and I loving reading, there's nothing more fun and excited than creating an application that solves a need of mine, based on a hobby!

## Technologies:

- React;
- Next.js;
- TypeScript;
- Tailwind;
- Figma;
- Firebase;
- Zod library;
- Vercel.

## Getting started

Running this project locally is easy, you just need to install all the dependencies used with the command `npm install` first, and after that use the command `npm run dev`.
