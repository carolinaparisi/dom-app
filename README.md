# Dom App Project

This project was thought for me with the intention of helping and making easier book's clubs voting the next volume for the next season ðŸ“š

Once I'm a participant of a book club and I loving reading, there's nothing more fun and excited than creating an application that solves a need of mine, based on a hobby!

### Layout

Its design was initially intended for the app to be used on mobile devices. Here we have the Figma prototype created by [CÃ¡ssio](https://github.com/cassiorsfreitas)! Even thought this layout was not created by me, as you can see in other projects here, on my GitHub, I've been using this strong tool to create my prototypes!
